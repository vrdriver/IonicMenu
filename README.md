# IonicMenu
A menu for Ionic developers so you don't have to type commands all the time.

I got sick of having to look up the commands for doing Ionic and Capacitor commands for common things.
So, I've made a quick menu for mac users.


Copy the menu.sh file to your root path of the project's source code.

Then, run 

chmod +x menu.sh

then run

./menu.sh
