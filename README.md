# Steve's Ionic Menu for Developers
A menu for Ionic and CapacitorJS developers so you don't have to type commands all the time.

I got sick of having to look up the commands for doing Ionic and Capacitor commands for common things.


Here is a quick bash script  for Mac users, so that you just run one script and have the common things you need.

Copy the `menu.sh` file to your root path of the project's source code.

Firstly change the permission with: 

    chmod +x menu.sh

Then run to get the menu up:

    ./menu.sh
